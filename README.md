# HandwrittenDigitRecognitionMNIST
The "Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Deep Learning" project aims to develop an advanced machine learning system capable of accurately recognizing and classifying handwritten digits. Leveraging the power of deep learning techniques, this project intends to create a robust and efficient model that can accurately interpret and classify numerical characters written by hand.

The project will utilize a deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a large dataset of handwritten digits. This dataset will consist of thousands of labeled examples, containing handwritten images of digits ranging from 0 to 9.
